# infection  
  
A C++ program that simulates an infection through terminal ASCII characters. So far, I have implemented regular humans, 
infected humans, nurses (who can heal infected people), and dead people (who will no longer be able to move).  
  
I hope to eventually optimize this code and make it look a lot better than it currently does.
